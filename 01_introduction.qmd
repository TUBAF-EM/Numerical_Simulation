## Content
In Geophysics, we are measuring a lot of different fields and try to use this for getting insight into the subsurface by using our knowledge of the physics.
Numeric solutions are key to understanding the nature of the physical equations and to predict measurements. In the inverse problem, the solution of the forward problem, i.e. to predict synthetic data from a given parameter distribution, is the most important task and therefore also for the data analysis in geophysics.

## Literature

There are hardly any textbooks covering numerical simulation methods in geophysical applications. Mostly, they are focused on the specific modelling purpose like electrodynamics (Haber), seismic wave modelling (Igel) geodynamics (Morra).
Numerical recipes have been around for Fortran and C/C++, but higher-level programming languages are easier to use in academics.
Besides the proprietary Matlab, Python has become the most widespread programming language in academia and research, which is why we use this here.

## Differential operators

The physical fields are mostly governed by partial differential equations with differential operators in space and time.
There are single derivatives in space $\pdv{x}$ or time $\pdv{t}$.
All derivatives into all spatial dimensions are subsumed in the *nabla* operator $\grad=(\pdv x, \pdv y, \pdv z)^T$.
The (negative) gradient of a potential is the corresponding vector field with directions perpendicular to the isosurfaces into the direction of decreasing potential.


The divergence applies the nabla operator to a vectorial field by the dot product:
$$\div \vb F = \pdv{F_x}{x} + \pdv{F_y}{y} + \pdv{F_z}{z}$$
The *divergence* of a field describes the source strength using Gauss' law.

The *curl* (rotation) operator occurs particularly in electromagnetic problems, where magnetic fields are caused by (conduction or displacement) currents and electric fields infer changes in the magnetic field.
It is described by the cross-product between nabla operator and the field
$$\curl \vb F = (\pdv{F_z}{y}-\pdv{F_y}{z}, \pdv{F_x}{z}-\pdv{F_z}{x}, \pdv{F_y}{x}-\pdv{F_x}{y})^T$$

There are two laws concerning curl fields:

1. curls have no divergence: $$\div (\curl \vb F)=0$${#eq-divcurl}
2. potential fields have no curl $$\curl (\grad u)=0$${#eq-curlgrad}

## Partial differential equations (PDEs)

Mostly: solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) for either scalar (potentials) or vectorial (fields) quantities.

### Types of partial differential equations

Let $u$ denote the searched function, $f$ the source (force) and $a$/$c$ are material parameters.
Depending on the occurring derivatives, we distinguish three main

* **elliptic** (potentials) PDE of Poisson type
$$-\nabla^2 u=f$$
or Helmholtz type
$$\nabla^2 u + k^2 u = f$$
* **parabolic** (diffusion processes) PDE
$$-\nabla^2 u + a \pdv{u}{t} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f$$
* **hyperbolic** (wave propagation) PDE
$$-\nabla^2 u + c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=f$$,
which can also have a diffusive term
$$\frac{\partial^2\ u}{{\partial x}^2} - c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = 0$$

There are also other types:

* coupled $\nabla\cdot u=f$ & $u = K \nabla p=0$ (Darcy flow)
* nonlinear $(\nabla u)^2=s^2$ (Eikonal equation)

### Poisson equation

![](pics/gravityPotential.png)

A potential field $u$ generates a vector field $\vb F=-\nabla u$ along its gradient, which in turn can cause some flow $\vb j=a \vb F$, where $a$ is some sort of conductivity (electric, hydraulic, thermal).
Part of the flow is generated (injected) by our source, denoted as $\vb j_s$.

The continuity of flow states that the divergence of total current $\vb j + \vb j_s$ vanishes, i.e., taking Gauss' law into account, in an arbitrary volume the sum of the currents flowing into (its normal vector) is zero:

$$ -\div (a \nabla u) = \div \vb j_s $$

The operator on the left-hand side is called Laplace operator, a (negative) second derivative, i.e. the first derivative of the conductivity-weighted potential gradient.
Discarding $a$ for a moment, a increasing first derivative is a positive curvature, typically a minimum of a curve.
Since we have a negative second derivative, we have a negative curvature, typically a maximum, at in the vicinity of a source (the right-hand side), where current flows into the system.

### The heat equation in 1D

sought: Temperature $T$ as a function of space and time

heat flux density $\vb q = \lambda\grad T$

$q$ in W/m², $\lambda$ - heat conductivity/diffusivity in W/(m.K)

Fourier's law: $\pdv{T}{t} - a \nabla^2 T = s$  ($s$ - heat source)

temperature conduction $a=\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}$ ($\rho$ - density, $c$ - heat capacity)

## Flow and transport
### Darcy's law

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

volumetric flow rate $Q$ caused by gradient of pressure $p$

$$ Q = \frac{k A}{\mu L} \Delta p $$

$$\vb q = -\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla p $$

$$\div\vb q = -\div (k/\mu \grad p) = 0$$

### Stokes equation

$$ \mu \nabla^2 \vb v - \grad p + f = 0 $$

$$\div\vb v = 0 $$

### Navier-Stokes equations
(incompressible, uniform viscosity)

$$ \pdv{\vb u}{t} +(\vb u \vdot \grad) \vb u = \nu \nabla^2 \vb u - 1/\rho \grad p + f $$

## Electromagnetics
### Maxwell's equations

* Faraday's law: currents & varying electric fields $\Rightarrow$ magnetic field
$$ \curl \vb H = \pdv{\vb D}{t} + \vb j $$
* Ampere's law: time-varying magnetic fields induce electric field
$$ \curl\vb E = -\pdv{\vb B}{t}$$
* $\div\vb D = \varrho$ (charge $\Rightarrow$), $\div\vb B = 0$ (no magnetic charge)
* material laws $\vb D = \epsilon \vb E$ and $\vec B = \mu \vb H$

## Helmholtz equations

e.g. from Fourier assumption $u=u_0 e^{\imath\omega t}$

$$ \div (a\grad u) + k^2 u = f $$

* Poisson operator assembled in stiffness matrix $\vb A$
* additional terms with $u_i$ $\Rightarrow$ mass matrix $\vb M$

$$ \Rightarrow \vb A + \vb M = \vb b $$

## Helmholtz equations

$$ \nabla^2 u + k^2 u = f $$

results from wavenumber decomposition of diffusion or wave equations

approach: $\vb F = \vb{F_0}e^{\imath\omega t} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \pdv{\vb F}{t}=\imath\omega\vb F \quad\Rightarrow\quad \pdv[2]{\vb F}{t}=-\omega^2\vb F$

$$ \nabla^2 \vb F - a \nabla_t \vb F - c^2 \nabla^2_t \vb F = 0 $$

$$ \Rightarrow \nabla^2\vb F - a\imath\omega\vb F + c^2 \omega^2\vb F = 0 $$

# Wave equations
## The eikonal equation

Describes first-arrival times $t$ as a function of velocity ($v$) or slowness ($s$)

$$ |\grad t| = s = 1/v $$
